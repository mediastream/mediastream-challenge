# Mediastream challenge's solution by Sebastian

**Please run scripts directly, since `npm run` has problems with input piping (on Windows, at east)**

#### Test Nº1 (Basic CS)
Just run normally:
```
node 01-basic-cs
``` 


#### Test Nº2 (JS)
This solution has a nice interactive menu made with `inquirer` to call its different tasks. Start by typing the name of any repository (defaults to `mediastream`) 
```
node 02-javascript
``` 


#### Test Nº3 (NodeJS)
This solution allows limiting results by using:
```
limit=10 node 03-nodejs
```
